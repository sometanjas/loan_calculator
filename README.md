# loan_calculator

Creating a loan calculator project has been a great learning experience for me. 
The main focus was to apply math concepts in real-life situations using Python, and it helped me get comfortable with third-party modules and libraries. 
Exploring financial instruments and their calculations was a practical way to understand personal finance.
A pivotal aspect of this journey involved parsing command-line arguments, introducing me to the intricacies of the command-line interface (CLI).

In summary, this project has been a hands-on way for me to practice math, enhance my Python skills, and learn about financial tools. 
Parsing command-line arguments was a new skill added to my toolkit, making the whole experience valuable in real-world applications.
